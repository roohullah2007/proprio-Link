- `est_verifie` (verification status)
- `created_at` (member since date)
- `email_verified_at` (email verification status)
- `derniere_connexion` (last login date)

### Routes Required
Ensure these routes are available:
- `profile.update` (PATCH)
- `password.update` (PUT)
- `profile.destroy` (DELETE)
- `verification.send` (POST)

### Backend Compatibility
The forms expect the Laravel backend to handle:
- Profile information updates with French field names
- Password updates with proper validation
- Account deletion with password confirmation
- Email verification link sending

2. **Image Optimization**: Avatar and any uploaded images
3. **Form Debouncing**: Real-time validation with debounced requests
4. **Caching**: User data caching for better performance

## Integration with Existing System

### Translation Integration
The updated profile page uses the existing translation system and expects these translation keys:

```javascript
// Profile page translations needed
"Profile Settings"
"Profile Information"
"Update your account's profile information and email address."
"Update Password" 
"Ensure your account is using a long, random password to stay secure."
"Delete Account"
"Permanently delete your account and all associated data."
"Property Owner"
"Real Estate Agent" 
"Administrator"
"Verified Account"
"Pending Verification"
"Account Information"
"Member Since"
"Email Status"
"Last Login"
"Never"
// ... and more form-specific translations
```

### Component Dependencies
The profile page relies on existing components:
- `AuthenticatedLayout`
- `InputError`
- `InputLabel` 
- `TextInput`
- `Modal`
- Translation utilities (`useTranslations`)

### Styling Dependencies
Uses the existing Tailwind CSS configuration and custom color classes:
- Custom green colors (`#065033`, `#054028`)
- Inter font family
- Consistent spacing utilities
- Border and background colors

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Setup
1. Ensure all translation keys are added to language files
2. Verify route definitions match the form expectations
3. Test with actual user data structure
4. Validate backend field mapping

### Database Requirements
The profile update functionality expects these user table fields:
```sql
-- Ensure these columns exist in users table
prenom VARCHAR(255)
nom VARCHAR(255) 
email VARCHAR(255)
telephone VARCHAR(255)
type_utilisateur ENUM('PROPRIETAIRE', 'AGENT', 'ADMIN')
est_verifie BOOLEAN
created_at TIMESTAMP
email_verified_at TIMESTAMP
derniere_connexion TIMESTAMP
```

### Security Considerations
1. **CSRF Protection**: Ensure all forms have CSRF tokens
2. **Rate Limiting**: Profile updates and password changes
3. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all fields
4. **Password Requirements**: Enforce strong password policies
5. **Account Deletion**: Proper data cleanup and audit trails

## Maintenance Notes

### Code Organization
- Each form component is self-contained with its own state management
- Consistent naming conventions follow the existing codebase
- Proper separation of concerns between UI and business logic
- Modular design allows for easy updates to individual sections

### Update Process
When updating the profile page in the future:
1. Update translation files first
2. Test each form component individually
3. Verify responsive design at different breakpoints
4. Check accessibility compliance
5. Update this documentation

### Monitoring
Consider monitoring these metrics:
- Profile completion rates
- Password change frequency
- Account deletion requests
- Form validation errors
- User engagement with different sections

## Conclusion

The profile page has been successfully modernized to match the dashboard design while improving functionality and user experience. The implementation maintains backward compatibility while introducing modern UI patterns and enhanced security features.

The modular approach ensures maintainability and allows for future enhancements without major refactoring. All components follow the established design system and provide consistent user experience across the application.
