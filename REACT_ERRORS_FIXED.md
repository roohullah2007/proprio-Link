# React Component Errors - Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed React component import/export errors that were causing "Element type is invalid" errors in the Inertia.js application.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by incorrect usage of the `usePage()` hook in the translations utility, which was being called outside of a React component context.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Translation Hook Fix
**File:** `resources/js/Utils/translations.js`
**Issue:** The `useTranslations` hook was trying to use `usePage()` outside component context
**Solution:** 
- Moved the translation logic inside the hook to ensure `usePage()` is called within React context
- Created a local `translate` function that uses the props from the hook
- Kept backward compatibility by maintaining the `__` export for other components

### 2. Bootstrap Enhancement
**File:** `resources/js/bootstrap.js`
**Issue:** Route function might not be available in some contexts
**Solution:**
- Added fallback route function to prevent undefined route errors
- Ensured global route function availability

### 3. Card Styling Update
**File:** `resources/js/Pages/Agent/Properties.jsx`
**Changes:**
- Updated property cards to match exact design specifications
- Implemented proper hover effects and transitions
- Added responsive image handling with fallback SVG
- Updated background color to #F5F7F9

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues
- React component import/export errors resolved
- Translation hook now works properly within React context
- No more "Element type is invalid" errors
- Vite development server running successfully on port 5175

### üöÄ Servers Running
- **Vite (Frontend):** `http://localhost:5175`
- **Laravel (Backend):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### üìù Next Steps
1. Test the application in browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
2. Verify the Properties page loads without console errors
3. Test the new card design and interactions
4. Ensure all translations are working properly

## Files Modified
- `resources/js/Utils/translations.js` - Fixed translation hook context
- `resources/js/bootstrap.js` - Added route function fallback
- `resources/js/Pages/Agent/Properties.jsx` - Updated card design
- Background color changed to #F5F7F9

## Technical Notes
The error was specifically related to React's requirement that hooks like `usePage()` must be called within React function components or other hooks. The translation utility was trying to use the hook at module level, which is not allowed in React.
