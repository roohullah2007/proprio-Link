# Navigation Active State Fix - Complete ✅

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Translation Debugger
- ✅ Removed TranslationDebugger component from Admin Dashboard
- ✅ Cleaned up debug imports
- ✅ Removed excessive console logging from translation function

### 2. Fixed Admin Navigation Active States
- ✅ **Admin Panel** tab now only shows active on `/admin/dashboard`
- ✅ **Moderation** tab shows active on:
  - `/admin/properties/pending` (Pending Properties)
  - `/admin/properties/{id}/review` (Property Review) 
  - `/admin/properties/all` (All Properties)

### 3. Navigation Behavior Now
```
When on Admin Dashboard:
├── Admin Panel (ACTIVE - underlined)
└── Moderation (inactive)

When on any Moderation page:
├── Admin Panel (inactive) 
└── Moderation (ACTIVE - underlined)
```

## Technical Changes Made

### AuthenticatedLayout.jsx
**Before:**
```jsx
// Both tabs showed active on any admin page
active={route().current('admin.*')}
```

**After:**
```jsx
// Admin Panel - only active on dashboard
active={route().current('admin.dashboard')}

// Moderation - active on all moderation routes  
active={route().current('admin.pending-properties') || 
       route().current('admin.property-review') || 
       route().current('admin.all-properties')}
```

## Test Results Expected

1. **Go to Admin Dashboard** → "Admin Panel" shows underlined
2. **Click "Moderation"** → "Moderation" shows underlined, "Admin Panel" becomes normal
3. **Navigate between moderation pages** → "Moderation" stays underlined
4. **Go back to Admin Dashboard** → "Admin Panel" shows underlined again

The navigation now properly indicates which section you're currently in, with clean active states and no visual clutter.
