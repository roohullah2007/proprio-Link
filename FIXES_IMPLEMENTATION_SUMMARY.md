# PROPIO FIXES IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ SMTP Settings inputs/data not appearing in Admin
**Problem**: SMTP settings were not visible or working in the admin panel.

**Solution**:
- Updated `SettingsController.php` to ensure SMTP settings are always included in default settings
- Migration `2025_06_27_140001_add_smtp_settings_to_admin_settings.php` adds SMTP settings to database
- Settings page already had SMTP configuration UI in the "Email Settings" tab

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/SettingsController.php`
- `database/migrations/2025_06_27_140001_add_smtp_settings_to_admin_settings.php`

**Test**: Go to `/admin/settings` → Click "Email Settings" tab → Enable custom SMTP → Fill settings → Test email

### 2. ✅ Successful payments showing "Failed" label under price in user detailed view
**Problem**: All non-succeeded payments were showing as "Failed" regardless of actual status.

**Solution**:
- Updated `UserDetails.jsx` to properly display different payment statuses
- Now shows: "Paid" (green), "Pending" (yellow), "Canceled" (gray), "Failed" (red)

**Files Modified**:
- `resources/js/Pages/Admin/UserDetails.jsx`

**Test**: Go to `/admin/users/{userId}` → Check "Purchase History" section → Verify status colors and labels

### 3. ✅ Invoices need to be displayed for Agent and Admin should see invoices
**Problem**: No invoice system was implemented for agents or admins.

**Solution**:
- Created complete invoice system with PDF generation
- Agent can view and download their invoices
- Admin can view all invoices with statistics
- Added professional PDF template

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `resources/js/Pages/Admin/Invoices.jsx` (Admin invoice management)
- `resources/js/Pages/Agent/Invoices.jsx` (Agent invoice view)
- `app/Http/Controllers/InvoiceController.php` (Updated with agent methods)
- `resources/views/invoices/template.blade.php` (PDF template)
- `routes/web.php` (Added agent invoice routes)

**Test**: 
- Agent: Go to `/agent/invoices` → View purchase history → Download PDFs
- Admin: Go to `/admin/invoices` → View all invoices → Filter/search → Download PDFs

### 4. ✅ Admin should see total stats of earnings through platform
**Problem**: Admin dashboard didn't show platform revenue statistics.

**Solution**:
- Updated `ModerationController.php` to include earnings stats
- Added earnings cards to admin dashboard
- Shows total earnings, monthly earnings, transaction counts

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/ModerationController.php`
- `resources/js/Pages/Admin/Dashboard.jsx`

**Test**: Go to `/admin/dashboard` → Check earnings statistics cards
