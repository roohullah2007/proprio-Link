# Buy Contact Functionality Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis
The "Buy Contact" button on property detail pages was not properly checking if users were already authenticated as agents and redirecting them to the payment page accordingly. The flow needed to be:

1. **If user is logged in as an agent**: Redirect directly to payment page
2. **If user is logged in but not as an agent**: Show modal explaining they need agent account
3. **If user is not logged in**: Show login/signup options with agent account creation

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated PublicDetail.jsx Component
**File**: `resources/js/Pages/Property/PublicDetail.jsx`

**Key Changes**:
- Added `auth` prop to receive authentication data
- Updated `handleContactClick()` function to check authentication status and user type
- Created separate modal rendering logic for different scenarios:
  - `renderContactModal()` function handles three different states
  - Different UI for logged-in non-agents vs non-logged-in users
- Added proper redirects to payment page for authenticated agents

**New Logic Flow**:
```javascript
const handleContactClick = () => {
    if (auth && auth.user) {
        const user = auth.user;
        
        if (user.type_utilisateur === 'AGENT') {
            // Direct redirect to payment page
            window.location.href = `/payment/properties/${property.id}`;
            return;
        } else {
            // Show modal for non-agent users
            setShowContactForm(true);
            return;
        }
    }
    
    // Show modal for non-authenticated users
    setShowContactForm(true);
};
```

### 2. Updated PropertyController.php
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/PropertyController.php`

**Changes**:
- Added `auth` data to the `showPublic` method response
- Now passes current user authentication status to the front-end

```php
return Inertia::render('Property/PublicDetail', [
    'property' => $property,
    'propertyTypes' => $propertyTypes,
    'similarProperties' => $similarProperties,
    'currentLocale' => app()->getLocale(),
    'auth' => [
        'user' => Auth::user(),
    ],
]);
```

### 3. Enhanced Login Flow
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php`

**Changes**:
- Updated `create()` method to pass `userType` parameter to login view
- Enhanced `store()` method to handle agent login redirects:
  - Detects if user is an agent and has an intended property URL
  - Redirects directly to payment page for that property after login

**New Login Logic**:
```php
public function store(LoginRequest $request): RedirectResponse
{
    $request->authenticate();
    $request->session()->regenerate();

    $user = Auth::user();
    $intendedUrl = $request->session()->get('url.intended');
    
    // If user is an agent and there's an intended URL that looks like a property page
    if ($user && $user->type_utilisateur === 'AGENT' && $intendedUrl) {
        if (preg_match('/\/property\/([a-f0-9-]+)/', $intendedUrl, $matches)) {
            $propertyId = $matches[1];
            return redirect("/payment/properties/{$propertyId}");
        }
    }

    return redirect()->intended(route('dashboard', absolute: false));
}
```

### 4. Updated Login Component
**File**: `resources/js/Pages/Auth/Login.jsx`

**Changes**:
- Added support for agent-specific login UI
- Shows different header and messaging when `type=agent` parameter is present
- Updated register link to maintain agent context

### 5. Enhanced Registration Flow
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php`

**Changes**:
- Updated `create()` method to pass `userType` to registration view
- Enhanced `store()` method to handle agent registration:
  - Stores property ID in session for post-verification redirect
  - Maintains intended URL context through registration and email verification

### 6. Updated Register Component
**File**: `resources/js/Pages/Auth/Register.jsx`

**Changes**:
- Added support for agent-specific registration UI
- Automatically selects "AGENT" as user type when `type=agent` parameter is present
- Shows agent-specific messaging and benefits

### 7. Enhanced Email Verification
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/VerifyEmailController.php`

**Changes**:
- Updated verification redirect logic to handle agent payment flow
- After email verification, agents are redirected to payment page if they have a pending property purchase

```php
// Check if there's a pending property payment for agents after verification
if ($user->type_utilisateur === 'AGENT' && $request->session()->has('payment_property_id')) {
    $propertyId = $request->session()->pull('payment_property_id');
    return redirect("/payment/properties/{$propertyId}")->with('verified', true);
}
```

## User Flow Examples

### Scenario 1: Logged-in Agent
1. Agent views property page
2. Clicks "Buy Contact"
3. **Immediately redirected to payment page** - `/payment/properties/{id}`

### Scenario 2: Logged-in Non-Agent
1. User views property page
2. Clicks "Buy Contact"
3. Modal appears explaining agent account requirement
4. Option to create agent account

### Scenario 3: Non-logged-in User
1. Visitor views property page
2. Clicks "Buy Contact"
3. Modal appears with login/signup options
4. Links include `?type=agent` parameter
5. After login/signup as agent → redirected to payment page

### Scenario 4: New Agent Registration
1. User clicks "Become an Agent" from property page
2. Registration form pre-selects agent account type
3. After registration → email verification
4. After email verification → payment page for original property

## Testing the Fix

To test the functionality:

1. **Test as logged-in agent**: Should redirect directly to payment
2. **Test as logged-in property owner**: Should show modal with agent account creation option
3. **Test as guest**: Should show login/signup modal with agent options
4. **Test new agent registration**: Should maintain property context through entire flow

## URL Examples

The system now properly handles these URL patterns:
- `/property/{id}` - Property detail page
- `/login?redirect=/property/{id}&type=agent` - Agent login with redirect
- `/register?redirect=/property/{id}&type=agent` - Agent registration with redirect
- `/payment/properties/{id}` - Payment page for property contact

This fix ensures a seamless user experience where agents can quickly purchase property contacts while new users are guided through the appropriate account creation process.
