# ProPio Laravel React App - Error Fixes

## Issue Summary
The application had JSX syntax errors in the `Properties.jsx` file that prevented the Vite development server from compiling properly.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. JSX Structure Mismatch
**File:** `resources/js/Pages/Agent/Properties.jsx`
**Error:** Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for `<AuthenticatedLayout>` at line 481
**Issue:** Incorrectly nested div elements causing mismatched opening/closing tags

**Fixed by:**
- Corrected indentation and structure of nested div elements
- Properly aligned opening and closing tags
- Ensured consistent JSX hierarchy

### 2. Unused Import
**File:** `resources/js/Pages/Agent/Properties.jsx`
**Issue:** `useEffect` was imported but not used in the component

**Fixed by:**
- Removed unused `useEffect` import from React
