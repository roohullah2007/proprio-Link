# Propio Project - Dark Mode Removal and Navigation Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Agent Dashboard Navigation Fix
**File**: `resources/js/Layouts/AuthenticatedLayout.jsx`
- **Issue**: There were duplicate dashboard buttons in the header for agents
- **Fix**: Consolidated navigation so each user type has appropriate menu items:
  - **Property Owners**: Dashboard, My Properties, Add Property
  - **Agents**: Dashboard, Search Properties, My Contacts  
  - **Admins**: Admin Panel, Moderation
- **Result**: Removed duplicate "Dashboard" button for agents, cleaner navigation
