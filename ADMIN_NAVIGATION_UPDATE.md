# Admin Navigation - All Properties Link Added ✅

## Updated Admin Navigation

### **New Navigation Structure:**
```
Admin Panel  |  Moderation  |  All Properties
```

### **Active States:**
- **Admin Panel**: Active only on `/admin/dashboard`
- **Moderation**: Active on:
  - `/admin/properties/pending` (Pending Properties)
  - `/admin/properties/{id}/review` (Property Review)
- **All Properties**: Active only on `/admin/properties/all`

### **Navigation Behavior:**
1. **Admin Panel** → Shows dashboard with statistics and quick actions
2. **Moderation** → Shows pending properties for review/approval
3. **All Properties** → Shows complete overview of all properties (published, pending, rejected, sold)

## Benefits of Separate Links

### **Improved User Experience:**
- ✅ **Direct access** to all properties overview
- ✅ **Clear separation** between moderation tasks and general property management
- ✅ **Faster navigation** - no need to go through dashboard to reach all properties
- ✅ **Consistent navigation** pattern across admin interface

### **Cleaner Active States:**
- ✅ Each section has its own clear active state
- ✅ No overlap between moderation and property overview
- ✅ Better visual indication of current location

## Navigation Flow
